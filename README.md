## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

<b>CropDiseasePrediction</b> is a Progrssive Web APP (PWA) designed for automated crop disease detection and proposal of method for the prevention and cure of the disease. This app will help farmers to detect the diseases and how can they overcome it. It will also generate a detail report which will contain the disease names in number of species. If required, they can also verify it by the government authorities who will verify the report generated and will help with the input if required. The collected data will help our system to predict the diseases in more accurate way due to self-learning mechanism. The system will be easy to use with some basics functionalities which will make it user friendly for farmers.

## 1.1 Problem Definition

To develop an AI-Driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System

## 1.2 Project Description

Background: Crop diseases can devastate yields, leading to significant financial losses for farmers. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for effective management. Description: Develop an AI-driven system that analyzes crop images and environmental data to predict potential disease outbreaks. This system will provide farmers with actionable insights and treatment recommendations to mitigate risks. Expected Solution: A mobile and web-based application that utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify crop diseases and suggest preventive measures and treatments based on real-time data.
